            "* **Limited Range:**  Ultrasonic sensors have a limited range, meaning the system may not detect obstacles at a sufficient distance to allow for timely reaction.\n",
            "* **Calibration and Personalization:**  The system requires accurate calibration to the user's individual needs and sensitivity. A one-size-fits-all approach could be ineffective for some users.\n",
            "* **Battery Life and Charging:**  The wearable device and its components will require a reliable power source with sufficient battery life. Frequent charging could become a burden for users. \n",
            "\n",
            "**User Experience and Usability:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Overwhelming Sensory Input:**  The constant vibration feedback, especially in complex environments, could become overwhelming and even distracting for users, potentially hindering their navigation.\n",
            "* **Adaptation and Learning Curve:** Users may require significant time and practice to learn to interpret and respond to the various vibration patterns effectively.\n",
            "* **Social Considerations:**  The system may be perceived as intrusive or even stigmatizing by some users.  It could also potentially isolate individuals by creating a barrier in social interactions.\n",
            "* **Accessibility for all:**  The system must be accessible to individuals with varying levels of hearing impairment, as relying solely on vibrations might not be sufficient for everyone.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Cost and Scalability:**\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Production and Distribution:**  The cost of developing, producing, and distributing a sophisticated system with miniaturized technology could be prohibitive, limiting its accessibility to low-income communities.\n",
            "* **Maintenance and Repairs:**  Ongoing maintenance and repairs could be costly, posing a significant financial burden for users, particularly if the technology requires frequent updates or replacements.\n",
